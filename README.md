# Supervised-Machine-Learning-challenge

For a given data, the task is to create and compare two model using machine learning algorithm: a Logistic Regression, and a Random Forests Classifier to see which model performs better.
# Predict Model Performance
 Create, fit, and score the models, make a prediction as to which model will perform better.

# Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
Create the features DataFrame, X, by removing the loan_status column. Create y, the labels set, by using the loan_status column. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using the train_test_split function.

# Create, Fit and Compare Models
Create a Logistic Regression model, fit it to the training data that you created in the previous step. Then, determine the model's score by using the score function and the testing data from the previous step.
Then, Create a Random Forests Classifier model, fit it to the training data that you created in the previous step. Then, determine the model's score by using the score function and the testing data from the previous step.

# Conclsion
For the given data, Logistic Regression model performed better than the Random Forests Classifier.
